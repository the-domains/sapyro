THE CONCEPT,   Behaviour of a fire-front upon meeting the barrier. 

Heat reflection, preventing heat radiation from passing through and also sending the heat reflected back into the burning area.

Physical barrier, against flames and hot gases, which by convection will tend to rise in front of the screen and will be affected by the wind dynamics.

Air suction, towards the hot area from the cold area, produced by the depression of the rising convection current. This helps to stop the fire spreading under the barrier.

Lightness. The material is light enough to be transported and installed in mountainous terrain. It is also compact.

Strength. The screen or barrier offers high resistance to three basic factors: heat - withstanding high temperatures without losing its qualities; flames - it is fireproof and does not catch firre when it comesinto contact with flames; or when mechanically stressed. Furthermore, its installation systems are sufficiently stable, mainly against the wind.

Adaptability. The material used is easy to adapt to uneven, broken land, often rocky and overgrown.
