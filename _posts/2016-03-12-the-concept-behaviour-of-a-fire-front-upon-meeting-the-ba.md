* **Heat reflection**, preventing heat radiation from passing through and also sending the heat reflected back into the burning area

**Physical barrier**, against flames and hot gases, which by convection will tend to rise in front of the screen and will be affected by the wind dynamics

**Air suction**, towards the hot area from the cold area, produced by the depression of the rising convection current. This helps to stop the fire spreading under the barrier

**Lightness**. The material is light enough to be transported and installed in mountainous terrain. It is also compact

**Strength**. The screen or barrier offers high resistance to three basic factors:  1\.**heat** - withstanding high temperatures without losing its qualities;  2\.**flames** - it is fireproof and does not catch fire when it comes into contact with flames; or when **mechanically** stressed. Furthermore, its installation systems are 3\. **sufficiently stable**, mainly against the wind

**Adaptability.** The material used is easy to adapt to uneven, broken land, often rocky and overgrown
